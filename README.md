## Hack OHI/O 2019 Project
Repository for work on our Hack OHI/O Hackathon 2019 project. This is work we will do after the event is over and will be done outside the 24-hours allowed during the event.


## Introduction

Originally we wanted to make a game related to Ohio State. We tried for around 6 hours to get our initial idea working and then scrapped it. After scrapping it, we then decided to go with a much simpler game, but unfortunetely still did not finish in time. This was our first hackathon as a team, and for each of us individually too. We all had a lot of fun and gained a lot of valuable knowledge during this undertaking.

## Our Story

We're four roommates who have lived together since the beginning of our college careers in August of 2018. The name "341 Boys" was given to use because, well, we were in room number 341, and we're all boys (men, rather). So, 341 Boys has been our name, and coding is our game!
